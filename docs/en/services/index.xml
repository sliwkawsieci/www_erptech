We eliminate waste, optimize flows, and build continuous improvement cultures – all within one integrated system.
Waste elimination. We identify and remove 8 types of Muda (overproduction, waiting, transport, overprocessing, inventory, unnecessary movement, defects, unused potential).
Continuous improvement (Kaizen). Built-in KPI monitoring mechanisms, bottleneck analysis, and optimization suggestions.
Value stream mapping. Mapping processes from raw material to finished product with clear visualization of value added.</description></item><item><title>EOD</title><link>https://erptech.pl/en/services/eod/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erptech.pl/en/services/eod/</guid><description>EOD System in ERPnext ERPnext offers a comprehensive electronic document management solution:
